At Skyworkz we don't have a strict protocol on how an engineer should get started on a project but, 
we see some patterns and behaviors regarding how a Skyworkz engineer will get started on a project.

# First Week

## Start learning about the project and the team

* Ask (basic) questions to make implicit knowledge visible. Your first week is for asking stupid questions ðŸ˜Š

## Getting to know people

* It's common to have introductory meetings during an onboarding process. It should help engineers getting to know who are their stakeholders, managers, and people able to help whenever a question pops up. 

## Getting to know the technical landscape

'Reverse Document': create a landscape overview that reflects your understanding of what you've learned, questions, potential issues, etc

1:1 with your direct coworkers. Who are they? Why are they here? What makes them tick? What struggles do they have? Who do they think you should have coffee with?

Draw diagrams and write documentation. Present to your coworkers and confirm assumptions.

Be in 'blameless post-mortem' mode all the time. You want to find the skeletons in the closet, but you're not here to identify the killer (you need those people for the solution)

# First Month

## Identifying stakeholders

## Identifying (implicit) power structure & dynamics

## Align expectations
